<h1>Snow Profile Editor</h1>

This is software that creates a drag-and-drop in-brower drawing tool
to create and store a snow profile, used in snow safety and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche">avalanche</a>
forecasting. 

A snow profile is a cross-section diagram of conditions in the snow at
a moment in time and a specified location. The symbols and terminology
of such diagrams are defined in the
<a
href="http://www.cryosphericsciences.org/products/snowClassification/snowclass_2009-11-23-tagged-highres.pdf">IACS
 2009 Standard</a>. This module
provides a drag-and-drop browser tool to create such a diagram, with
the ability to save the finished diagram in the Drupal database as
both a PNG file and a data set. The data can be loaded and updated in
the browser after initial storage.

The drawing tool provided by this module depends on browser support
for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>
and JavaScript code to manipulate SVG entities. The tool works
in recent versions of popular browsers, but will not work in many old
browsers.

described on pp. 175-180 of the second edition.
