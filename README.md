# Interactive snow profile editor

This is JavaScript that provides an editor to allow creation of snow profile
diagrams by the simple interactions of dragging and dropping or selecting
from a dropdown menu.  It uses the HTML 5 canvas element and the
[KineticJS]{@link http://kineticjs.com/} library.
