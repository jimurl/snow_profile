<h1>Snow Profile Editor</h1>

This is software that creates a drag-and-drop in-brower drawing tool
to create and store a snow profile, used in snow safety and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche">avalanche</a>
forecasting. 

A snow profile is a cross-section diagram of conditions in the snow at
a moment in time and a specified location. The symbols and terminology
of such diagrams are defined in the
<a
href="http://www.cryosphericsciences.org/products/snowClassification/snowclass_2009-11-23-tagged-highres.pdf">IACS
 2009 Standard</a>. This module
provides a drag-and-drop browser tool to create such a diagram, specifically 
tailored for use with the <a href="http://snowpilot.org">SnowPilot</a> web application.

The drawing tool provided by this module depends on browser support
for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>
and JavaScript code to manipulate SVG entities. The tool works
in recent versions of popular browsers, but will not work in many old
browsers.

For a general discussion of avalanches and snow safety see
<a
href="http://www.mountaineersbooks.org/Staying-Alive-in-Avalanche-Terrain-2nd-Ed-P512.aspx">Staying
Alive In Avalanche Terrain</a> by Bruce Tremper. Snow profiles are
described on pp. 175-180 of the second edition. 

This project is based off the original module which was written pro bono for the
<a href="http://utahavalanchecenter.org/">Utah Avalanche Center</a> by Walt Haas.
